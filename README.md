# Ciao, I'm Devis Dal Moro 🇮🇹🤌

I’m a Robotics Software Engineer and Researcher working at the intersection of **autonomous decision-making, human–robot interaction, and AI-powered robotic systems**. 
My work focuses on building expressive, scalable cognitive architectures that allow robots to operate safely and intelligently in dynamic, human-centered environments.
